# Pizza-Sales-Analysis

## Tools:
- SQL
- Power BI
  
## KPI's REQUIREMENTS:
- Total Revenue: The sum of the total prices of all pizzas
- Average Order Value: The average amount spent on an order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders
- Total Pizzas Sold: The sum of the quantities of total pizzas sold
- Total Orders: The total number of orders placed
- Average Pizzas per Order: The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders

## CHART REQUIREMENTS:
- Daily Trends for Total Order: Create a bar chart that displays the daily trend of total orders over a specific period of time. This chart will help us identify any patterns or fluctuations in order volumes on a daily basis
- Monthly Trend for Total Orders: Create a line chart that illustrates an hourly trend of total orders throughout the day. This chart will allow us to identify the peak hours or periods of high-order activity
- Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category: Create a Donut chart that shows the distribution of sales across different pizza categories. The chart will provide insight into the popularity of various pizza categories and their contribution to overall sales
- Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size: Generate a Donut chart that represents the percentage of sales attributed to different pizza sizes. This chart will help us know the preferences of customers based on the size of pizza and its contribution to sales
- Total Pizzas sold By Pizza Category: Create a funnel chart that shows the sales of pizza by a specific category. This chart will help us see the difference in sales for all the categories.
- Top 5 Pizzas by Revenue, Total Quantity, and Total Orders: Create a bar chart highlighting the top 5 performing pizzas based on revenue, quantity, and orders. This chart will help us identify the best-selling pizzas during the given period of time.

## Summary:
- The creation of interactive dashboards, sophisticated functions, and result validation are highlighted.
- Imported the CSV file into MS SQL Server and calculated the required parameters. After the calculation, the SQL Server is further connected to Power BI in order to perform the given tasks and plot various kinds of charts and visuals.
- After connecting to Power BI, Cleared all the ambiguity present in the data to further process it and make it clean for the plotting.
- The project entails developing doughnut charts for pizza sales by category, a funnel chart, daily/monthly trend charts, and interactive dashboards with KPIs.
- Data from an MS SQL Server database is imported and queried using SQL, with documented queries for reference.
- Data cleaning, the creation of custom columns, and chart-based visualization are all performed using Power BI.
- Two dashboards are created: one to track KPIs and the other to track the best- and worst-selling pizzas.
- KPIs include total revenue, average order value, number of orders, number of pizzas sold, and average number of pizzas per order.
- Charts show daily and monthly data.
